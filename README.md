### Explain version control.

**Version control**, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code

In software engineering, **version control** is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. One example of **version control** is **Git**.


### Explain difference between git and github

**Git** and **GitHub** are related but serve different purposes in the context of version control and collaboration in software development.

**Git:**

**Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS) that was created by Linus Torvalds.
It is a tool that helps developers track changes in their code over time and collaborate with others.
**Git** allows developers to create branches, make changes, merge branches, and track the history of changes made to a codebase.
It operates locally on your computer and does not require a connection to a central server for most operations.
GitHub:

**GitHub**, on the other hand, is a web-based platform and service that uses Git for version control.
It provides a central location (repository) where developers can store and share their Git repositories.
**GitHub** adds a social and collaborative layer on top of Git, allowing multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously.
It provides features like pull requests, issues, and wikis that facilitate collaboration and communication among team members.
GitHub also includes additional tools such as project management features, code review tools, and more.
In summary, Git is the version control system itself, while GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and adds collaboration features. Git can be used without GitHub, and there are other alternatives to GitHub (like GitLab and Bitbucket), but GitHub is one of the most popular platforms for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on projects.

### Explain the difference between git fetch and git pull

| S/N | git fetch | git pull
| -- | ----- | ----- |
| 1. | It retrieves changes from the remote repository but does not automatically merge them to the local working branch | It automatically retrieves changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local working branch.|
| 2. | It fetches only, you still have to merge the changes separately to effect changes | It is a combination of fetching and merging. |


### Explain in simple terms git rebase and the command for it
